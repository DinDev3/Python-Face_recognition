# Python-Face_recognition
This repository contains Python code that is capable of various face recognition functions.

This is my starting point in implementing Machine Learning algorithms for software solutions.

## Helpful GitHub repos to learn how to implement facial recognition using Python

[ageitgrey's face_recognition repo](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)<br/>
[Traversy media's face_recognition repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/face_recognition_examples)

You can watch Traversy media's YouTube video that helped me get a kick start on facial recognition using machine learning [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSTnwsZj2yc)

## How to install *dlib* face recognition library on Windows

1. Open *pipenv* virtual environment in the terminal
2. Run "pip install cmake" in the terminal; to install cmake
3. Install Microsoft Build tools inorder to install C++ compiler
4. Run "pip install dlib" in the terminal
5. Run "pip install face_recognition" in the terminal<br/><br/>

You're good to go now!<br/>
You can even delete the Microsoft Build tools applications hereafter.<br/><br/>

*The dlib library only worked with Python when this method was followed.*<br/>
