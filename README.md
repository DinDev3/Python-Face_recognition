# Python-Face_recognition
This repository contains Python code that is capable of various face recognition functions.

This is my starting point in implementing Machine Learning algorithms for software solutions.

## How to install *dlib* face recognition library on Windows

1. Open *pipenv* virtual environment in the terminal
2. Run "pip install cmake" in the terminal; to install cmake
3. Install Microsoft Build tools inorder to install C++ compiler
4. Run "pip install dlib" in the terminal

You can even delete the Microsoft Build tools applications hereafter.
